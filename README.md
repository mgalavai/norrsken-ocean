# Bio-Architect: Global Restoration Initiative

**Bio-Architect** is a scientific strategy simulation where you act as a bio-engineer tasked with restoring Earth's collapsed ecosystems. Using the Protein Matrix, you synthesize novel organisms capable of surviving extreme climate conditions—rising temperatures, acidity, and pollution—to re-stabilize the planetary biosphere.

## Core Features
- **Global Climate Simulation**: Real-time integration of NASA/NOAA data (SST, Bleaching Alerts, Bathymetry) to generate mission parameters.
- **Protein Matrix Lab**: A drag-and-drop variation of the "15-puzzle" to synthesize organism genetic sequences.
- **Organism Deployment**: Deploy your creations into 3D ocean environments and watch them adapt or fail against environmental stressors.
- **Cyber-Scientific UI**: A sleek, glassmorphic interface inspired by advanced research protocols.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **3D Engine**: Three.js + React Three Fiber
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Data**: NASA JPL MUR SST, NOAA Coral Reef Watch
